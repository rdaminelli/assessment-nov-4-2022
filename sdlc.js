// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const AnalysisOfRequirements = "In this step requirements are defined, such as, what the project is supposed to do, and what are its requirements. An exemple would be what and how a car share application requests information from their drivers."

const design = "The design of project concerns how the software will work, including languages used, in what plataform it will work, how the user interface looks, how security works, etc."

const implementations = "Once the design has been difined, the implemation phase is when the design turns into source code, considering all the components of the design."

const testingAndIntegration = "With the code completed, testing is done to clear it from bugs or defects, and to be sure the software is ready for the user. This is done until the software is up to the client's standard."

const maintain = "After the sofware is released to the costumer, maintance serves to correct any error that may come along or to improve on the software's functionality."
